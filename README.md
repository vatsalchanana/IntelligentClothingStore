Propose a deep learning based predictive model to recommend a list of products based on users’ previous reviews, the product he is currently viewing and the initial search query that he provided.
 - Build an efficient Product Recommender System.
 - Recommendations are based on Collaborative Filtering, Deep Learning, Transfer Learning and Clustering.
 - The system must suggest products to the user which might be on interest based on his past reviews, current browsing pattern and specific requirements (if any). 
 
This project aims to build a system to recommend products to a user in three ways:
- Allow the user to click images of the products he liked and recommend visually similar products.
- If a user wants to look at a particular type of product like “blue jeans”, the system must recommend products similar to blue jeans.
- If a user is currently viewing a product, the system must recommend products similar to the product he is currently viewing.
- If there is a new user who hasn’t reviewed any products, the system should recommend something to him.
- The system must make the predictions fast in a low time complexity. This is an effort to implement mathematical predictive models to improve user experience by making them personalised/relevant recommendations. We believe in enhanced user experience by taking feedback/rating from him.
